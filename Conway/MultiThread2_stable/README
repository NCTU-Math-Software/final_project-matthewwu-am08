This is a relatively stable version, support directly edit at any time of run rather than hardcode in code.

Notice that this still required at least two Matlab boot simultaniously, and in author's computer, this cost at least 3.3GB ram.

Launch Method:

1. Launch 2 Matlab(Recommend 2020a or later) simultaniously.

2, Switch the dictionary to folder with two matlab script(v2_main.m and v2_t1.m)

3. Open two script separately with 2 matlab.

4. Boot v2_t1.m first.

5. Boot v2_main.m.

6. Enjoy.



Operation:

use "space"(or key code 32 if with customized Keyboard) to pause/resume.

while it's currently on puase method, use directly mouth's left click(or any un-defined key_ to add a new cell.

press R(or r) while pause to wipe all to white(Reset all condition.)

press G(or g) while pause to exit the simulation.
